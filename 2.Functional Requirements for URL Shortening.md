# **URL Shortener Functional Requirements**  

## **Explanation**  

### **What is a URL Shortener?**  
A URL shortener is a web service that converts long and complex URLs into shorter, easy-to-share links.  
For example:  
- Long URL: `https://www.example.com/very/long/path/that/is/difficult/to/share`  
- Short URL: `https://bit.ly/xyz123`  

When users click the short URL, they are redirected to the original long URL.

### **Why Do We Use URL Shortening?**  

#### **1. User Convenience:**  
- Long URLs are cumbersome to share, especially on platforms with character limits (e.g., Twitter).  
- They can break when pasted across multiple lines in messaging apps.  

#### **2. Media Constraints:**  
- Some platforms or communication channels restrict the length of text (e.g., SMS, Twitter).  
- Short URLs save space and make the message more readable.  

#### **3. Better Readability and Aesthetics:**  
- Shortened URLs look cleaner and are easier to remember or type.  
- Helps avoid messy, cluttered links in posts and documents.  

#### **4. Business Benefits:**  
- Businesses can brand their links (e.g., `es.pn/superbowl` instead of `bit.ly/w8qhgpn`).  
- Analyzing link performance helps track customer engagement and referral sources.

## **Core Functional Requirements:**  

1. **Shortening Long URLs:**  
   - Input: A long URL.  
   - Output: A shortened URL.  
   - Ensures that the shortened URL is unique.  

2. **Redirection:**  
   - Clicking on the shortened URL should navigate the user to the original long URL.  
   - The process must be fast and reliable.  

3. **Uniqueness of Short URLs:**  
   - Multiple submissions of the same long URL should result in **different short URLs**.  

---

## **Optional Functional Requirements:**  

1. **Custom URL Aliases:**  
   - Users can choose a custom suffix for the shortened link (e.g., `bit.ly/mycustomlink`).  

2. **Time-to-Live (TTL) for Links:**  
   - The link can have an expiration time, after which it becomes invalid.  

3. **Analytics and Tracking:**  
   - Track the number of clicks, location data, and referral sources.  
   - Provide businesses with insights into how their links are performing.

## **Top-Down Design Steps for Interviews:**  
1. **Gather Functional Requirements:**  
   - Clearly understand the problem statement.  
   - Ask clarifying questions if necessary.  
   - Explain the problem in plain language to demonstrate communication skills.

## **Fun Analogy:**  
Imagine your favorite book has a super long title:  
**"The Incredibly Long and Complex Story of How I Managed to Share a Link Without Shortening It"**  
Now, imagine you could call it:  
**"The Short Story"**  
Wouldn't it be easier to share with friends? URL shorteners do the same thing: take a long, complex URL and give you a neat, short version that‚Äôs easier to pass around. üìèüîó

## **Mnemonic to Remember:**  
**"SURE - Shorten, Uniqueness, Redirection, Extras"**  
- **S - Shorten** the long URL.  
- **U - Uniqueness** of each short link.  
- **R - Redirection** to the original URL.  
- **E - Extras** like custom links, TTL, and analytics.

## **Interview Questions with Answers:**  

### **1. Why do users prefer shortened URLs?**  
**Answer:**  
Users prefer shortened URLs because they are easy to share, look neat, save space on platforms with text limits, and can include custom branding for businesses.

### **2. What are the core functional requirements of a URL shortener?**  
**Answer:**  
The core functional requirements are:  
- Taking a long URL and returning a shortened version.  
- Redirecting users from the short URL to the original long URL.  
- Ensuring the shortened URL is unique, even for repeated long URL inputs.

### **3. What optional features can enhance a URL shortening service?**  
**Answer:**  
Optional features include:

### **4. How does a URL shortener handle duplicate long URLs?**  
**Answer:**  
A robust URL shortener ensures that each long URL generates a **unique shortened link**. Even if the same long URL is entered multiple times, the shortened link should be different.

### **Additional Teaching:**  
In a real-world system design interview, you may be asked to explain the **scalability** of the URL shortener, how to handle **high traffic**, and how to efficiently store **mapping between long and short URLs**. Always emphasize your understanding of:  
- **Data storage:** Efficient key-value pair handling.  
- **Performance optimization:** Low-latency redirection.  
- **Scalability:** Distributing traffic across servers for load balancing.
